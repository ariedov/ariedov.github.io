      <description>There is a website I made for some friends - https://www.getmanstudio.com which lives on a digitalocean droplet. The droplet had multiple uses for me in the past, but lately this website was the only thing living there, and I did not really want to pay the $6/mo for it, so the logical thing for me to do was to move the website.&#xA;It was also quite old, so a little remake wouldn&amp;rsquo;t hurt.</description>

      <description>I have to share this. After long search for a great cross-platform email app I tried&#xA;Thunderbird: works great, not so great outlook support. BlueMail: meh. I finally found the best app, which works great and suits perfectly my needs: Mailspring.&#xA;Happy emailing!</description>

      <description>I try to indroduce tests even to my side projects, just because tests fundamentally save time and make you think more about the project architecture.&#xA;So of course while using the famous flutter_bloc library for my projects I wanted a nice way to test it. I was very pleasantly surprised when I discovered that the library provides a very nice and elegant way to test the bloc via bloc_test.&#xA;First of all, add it to your dev dependencies:</description>

      <description>If you are looking for some docs on how to localize your flutter app, the official one is the way to go https://docs.flutter.dev/development/accessibility-and-localization/internationalization. Here I am only noting the steps, so I can recall that for my next app localization attempt with a Flutter app.&#xA;So the steps are as follows:&#xA;Add your flutter localization library in pubspec.yaml: dependencies: flutter: sdk: flutter flutter_localizations: # Add this line sdk: flutter # Add this line intl: ^0.</description>

      <title>Disable Webcam Audio on Linux</title>

      <description>Sometimes I play around with my sound devices, just because I have quite a few connected to my laptop. Sometimes it means I forget to switch them back to where they need to be.&#xA;This particularly works for my webcam audio, which is selected automatically when I change my output to hdmi audio.&#xA;To locate the desired audio device call cat /proc/asound/modules. My output looked like this:&#xA;0 snd_hda_intel 1 snd_hda_intel 2 snd_usb_audio Since I only have one usb audio device installed, and it is my webcam, I want to block snd_usb_audio.</description>

      <title>Adding Gradle Wrapper to an Existing Project</title>

      <description>Another little one today, I specifically tried to build the vlc-android app myself to fix a song title issue I have. However, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t building with the error&#xA;Gradle sync failed: Minimum supported Gradle version is 7.0.2. Current version is 6.8. If using the gradle wrapper, try editing the distributionUrl in /home/ariedov/Projects/vlc-android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties to gradle-7.0.2-all.zip (5 s 953 ms) but there is no gradle/* or gradlew included in the repository. That&amp;rsquo;s not how I usually have my repositories, so I did not have an immediate solution to that problem.</description>

      <description>Another short Dart tip today, and another one that occurred while testing some dart code, but most useful for me when parsing JSON.&#xA;Lists For List&amp;lt;dynamic&amp;gt; I got from a JSON Map, when trying to save them as List&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; the errors like:&#xA;type &amp;#39;List&amp;lt;dynamic&amp;gt;&amp;#39; is not a subtype of type &amp;#39;List&amp;lt;String&amp;gt;&amp;#39; The fix is as simple as using something like that:&#xA;List&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; correctList = &amp;lt;dynamic&amp;gt;[].cast&amp;lt;String&amp;gt;(); Maps And for JSON maps that I needed to be parsed as Map&amp;lt;String, String&amp;gt;:</description>

      <title>Reading File as String in Dart</title>

      <description>Reading a file in Dart is very straigthforward, so for this article not to be 4 lines long I have to write something down. I, personally, needed this for having a json in Unit tests.&#xA;final file = File(&amp;#34;path/to/file&amp;#34;); final fileContents = await file.readAsString(); Nice reading files in Dart to you =)</description>

      <description>I am writing this article since I had this issue on pretty much every linux installation. This will only work if you&amp;rsquo;re using pulseaudio for sound on Linux.&#xA;The general advice I found was editing every analog-input*.conf file in /usr/share/pulseaudio/alsa-mixer/paths/, however only changing analog-input-internal-mic.conf worked for me, since I only experienced the issue with the internal mic.&#xA;In the analog-input-internal-mic.conf change:&#xA;Under [Element Capture] set volume to zero Under [Element Internal Mic Boost] set volume to zero.</description>

      <description>The IDE First things first - Jetbrains. Rider is required, there is no other tool available for writing Xamarin code on Linux. Grab it here https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/&#xA;Make sure to install Xamarin.Android support plugin. The installation guide will also have that option available.&#xA;C# on Linux Next is mono - the layer which allows provides necessary tools to build C# code on Linux and Mac. https://www.mono-project.com/&#xA;Now the tricky stuff, installing Xamarin.</description>
