JetBrains JetBrains support for vim motions is extensive via the ideavim plugin, which adds support for all the motions you would need and even provides a handy .ideavimrc config file to tinker with. With the power of that, one could map every IDE action into a vim key binding, and finally achieve enlightenment use the IDE without needing to ever touch the mouse.</p></div><div class=post__footer><em class="fas fa-calendar-day"></em>

But there is an issue at hand: how to keep the backend code running after the ssh connection is lost? There are a few options.</p></div><div class=post__footer><em class="fas fa-calendar-day"></em>

This is a fun story about how the lack of documentation leads people to try out different options to make the tool work, even though it has nothing to do with how the tool is actually working.
The story features an experiment done on some birds to &ldquo;trigger the feeder&rdquo;, where the birds where fed at random but developed random superstitions they thought were the triggers for food (they weren&rsquo;t) wiki</p></div><div class=post__footer><em class="fas fa-calendar-day"></em>

Limbo https://github.com/tursodatabase/limbo
I already talked about Turso a few times before while collecting some knowledge, but they never ceize to amaze! They are rewriting SQLite in Rust now! More Rust! More!
Why can&rsquo;t we make simple software https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czzAVuVz7u4
As much as I&rsquo;d like to advocate for software simplicity, not overthinking, &ldquo;You Ain&rsquo;t Gonna Need It&rdquo; etc, that&rsquo;s not really a thing. With the need to support a million platforms, CPU architectures, screen sizes, input devices/options, network connectivity, storage, different communication protocols and millons of more things software will get complex. A great talk showcasing why simple software is not really a possibility.</p></div><div class=post__footer><em class="fas fa-calendar-day"></em>

Decpite the name, this talk is not about Neovim. Teej Devries is a core contributor of Neovim and created many useful plugins for the editor, and here he is talking about how working on it made him better. Believe it or not - it&rsquo;s not the motions.

Yes. You read it right. It is also ironically written in Rust. I love Rust just for that.</p></div><div class=post__footer><em class="fas fa-calendar-day"></em>

This is exactly what it seems. You press numbers. Notes get played. Very fun.
Someone was a vscode early adopter (with no git knowledge) https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/32405
Old but gold. Someone decided to try vscode in 2017, did not want to save their changes, pressed discard in the vcs window. EVERYTHING WAS DELETED!

He just wanted to play a little more &ldquo;Hollow Knight&rdquo; and I just wanted to direct that into something more creative and useful. So we came up with this silly game idea - &ldquo;Find the Egg!&rdquo;. It would just show a little grid and you&rsquo;d have to guess where on the grid the egg is.

Another developer I adore deeply since my Android days - Jake Wharton, is trying to make every platform more like android (for better or for worse). There are lots of different ways to make cross-platform applications, and Jake is trying to adapt the reactive kotlin UI (Compose). I am yet to try this (as many other things), but I trust Jake to create something solid.
Motion https://motion.dev/
There is one way to prove to someone that you know UI - stunning animations. While CSS is pretty good at this lately, there are ways to go. Motion lets you animate crazy stuff and make crazy looking websites. Just look at their own! They only supported React till recently, but now promise to support any frameworks or even vanilla JS.</p></div><div class=post__footer><em class="fas fa-calendar-day"></em>

Last week I learned about Turso, a company that provides SQLite as a service. Now I found that they actually open sourced their SQLite fork - libSQL with the MIT license, and it does have some pretty impressive features.
It does have vector support with vector math. It also have a feature called sqld - an sqlite backend that allows to split data between multiple sqlite files for ease of access. Now it doesn’t shard data like we do, but it’s still very impressive.
