Hello! My name is David and I've been profesionally programming since 2012.

Most of my career I was making Android applications for companies like Samsung, Megogo and many more, but I am rapidly expanding my knowledge and not limiting myself to any specific technology stack.

I have created multiple successful projects created with many different technologies, like:

- Android SDK
- iOS SDK (Swift UI)
- React
- NextJS
- Python (Django, Flask, FastAPI)
- Golang
- Lua
- and many many more

Digging deep is my special mantra, I never stop learning and improving. My GitHub is a project graveyard, but every tombstone is an ode to a learned skill.

I use Neovim BTW.
