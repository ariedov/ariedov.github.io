I have to share this. After long search for a great cross-platform email app I tried 
- [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/): works great, not so great outlook support. 
- [BlueMail](https://bluemail.me/): meh.
  
I finally found the best app, which works great and suits perfectly my needs: [Mailspring](https://getmailspring.com/).

Happy emailing!
