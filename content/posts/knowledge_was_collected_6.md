I already talked about Turso a few times before while collecting some knowledge, but they never ceize to amaze!
They are rewriting SQLite in Rust now! More Rust! More!


#### Why can't we make simple software

As much as I'd like to advocate for software simplicity, not overthinking, "You Ain't Gonna Need It" etc, that's not really a thing. With the need to support a million platforms, CPU architectures, screen sizes, input devices/options, network connectivity, storage, different communication protocols and millons of more things software will get complex. A great talk showcasing why simple software is not really a possibility.
