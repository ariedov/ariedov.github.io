#### Redwood

Another developer I adore deeply since my Android days - Jake Wharton, is trying to make every platform more like android (for better or for worse). There are lots of different ways to make cross-platform applications, and Jake is trying to adapt the reactive kotlin UI (Compose). I am yet to try this (as many other things), but I trust Jake to create something solid.

#### Motion

[https://motion.dev/](https://motion.dev/)

There is one way to prove to someone that you know UI - stunning animations. While CSS is pretty good at this lately, there are ways to go. Motion lets you animate crazy stuff and make crazy looking websites. Just look at their own! They only supported React till recently, but now promise to support any frameworks or even vanilla JS.
