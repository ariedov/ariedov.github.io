Lets bring a little fun on the holiday.

#### Play trumpet with your keyboard.

This is exactly what it seems. You press numbers. Notes get played. Very fun.

#### Someone was a vscode early adopter (with no git knowledge)

Old but gold. Someone decided to try vscode in 2017, did not want to save their changes, pressed discard in the vcs window. **EVERYTHING WAS DELETED!**

A story better told on Halloween.
