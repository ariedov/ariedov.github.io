#### libSQL

[GitHub - tursodatabase/libsql: libSQL is a fork of SQLite that is both Open Source, and Open Contributions.](https://github.com/tursodatabase/libsql)

Last week I posted about Turso, a company that provides SQLite as a service. Now I found that they actually open sourced their SQLite fork - libSQL with the MIT license, and it does have some pretty impressive features.
- It does have vector support with vector math.
- It also have a feature called sqld - an sqlite backend that allows to split data between multiple sqlite files for ease of access. Now it doesn’t shard data like we do, but it’s still very impressive.


#### The only unbreakable law

This one is a bit of a rabbit hole. A developer I respect deeply, Casey Muratori, gave a talk about his journey of finding a universal truth about software development, and found a few interesting ones.
- There is always a limit of how fast a development (or any) team can move, if the task requires communication. The video provides a formula, it’s very interesting.
- Every company only can produce copies of itself (Conways Law). It’s a bit hard to grasp at first, but it seems to be true. Casey is providing some neat and clever examples.

*Enjoy!*
